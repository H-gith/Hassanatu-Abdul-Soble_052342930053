        <section class="content">
        <p>Mujahideen Preparatory School has a history that spans over a decade.Our story began with the establishment of a small Arabic class about fifteen years ago with a small group of dedicated students and a passionate teacher.
            As the Arabic program flourished we recognized the need for a more comprehensive education that combined academic excellence with spiritual growth and character development.In 2022, we expanded our curriculum to include a full range of academic subjects with accordance to the Ghana Education Service curriculum,marking the official launch of the school.
